//closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)
// a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
// it inherit  from the  lexcial resource 
//Consequently, you can use a closure anywhere that you might normally use an object with only a single method.


const outerFun = (a)=> {                         //outerfunction
    let b =10;
    const innerFun = ()=>{                 //inner function
        let sum = a+b;

        console.log(`the sum of two no ${sum}`);
    }
innerFun();

//lexcial scope
//A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be
// accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration
