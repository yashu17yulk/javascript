//closure is the combination of a function bundled together  with references to its surrounding state  
 
 


const outerFun = (a)=> {                       
    let b =10;
    const innerFun = ()=>{                 

        console.log(`the sum of two no ${sum}`);
    }
innerFun();
}

outerFun(5);


//lexcial scope
//A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be
// accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration


/*
var sum = function (a,b,c){

    return{
        gettwosum(){
            return a+b;
        },
        getthreesum(){
                return a+b+c;
        }
    }
    }
    var store=sum(5,2,3);
    console.log(store.gettwosum());
    console.log(store.getthreesum());

//Advantages

/*
They help remove redundant code.

They help maintain modular code.

They provide data encapsulation.

Variables in closures can help you maintain a state that you can use later.

*/

//Disadvantages

/*
The variables declared inside a closure are not garbage collected.

Too many closures can slow down your application. This is actually caused by duplication of code in the memory.
